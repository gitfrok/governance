# Create an isolated worktree for one unit of work, scoped. SPEC-0013.
#
# Run from the SUPER-REPO root. Makes a git worktree inside one submodule, on a new branch, with the
# scope boundary hook installed and the scope recorded — so a commit that wanders outside what was
# declared fails locally rather than in review.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dispatch-worktree.sh <repo> <branch> <path-glob>...
#
#   repo        a submodule path from .gitmodules — the one this work targets (invariant 23)
#   branch      the branch to create in that submodule
#   path-glob   one or more globs, relative to the submodule root, that the work may touch
#
# Example:
#   scripts/dispatch-worktree.sh backend feat/pdp-cache 'modules/policy/**' '**/*_test.go'
#
# Prints the worktree path. It does not cd for you — a script cannot change its caller's directory,
# and pretending otherwise is how people end up committing in the wrong tree.

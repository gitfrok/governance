## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at `graphify-out/` with god nodes, community structure, and
cross-file relationships. It is built by a locally-installed tool; if `graphify` is not on your
PATH, nothing here applies and none of it is required.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing
anything else.

Rules:

- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when `graphify-out/graph.json`
  exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for
  focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than `GRAPH_REPORT.md` or
  raw grep output.
- Dirty `graphify-out/` files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are
  not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip it if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output,
  or the user says not to use it.
- If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for broad architecture review, or when query/path/explain
  do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

The graph is a **navigation aid, not a source of truth.** Where it disagrees with the tree, the tree
wins; where it disagrees with governance, governance wins (ADR-0001). It is also regenerated wholesale,
so nothing under `graphify-out/` is committed.
